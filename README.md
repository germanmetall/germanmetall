👋 Welcome to my page!

👩 My name is Herman Mossur, but you may also call me ?Leopold?

💙 I love being loved by God and spreading His Love

🌱 Too many Love? Ugh, fine, I also like math, history, culture, literature, tourism, cooking, tabletop games, having a laugh and a sleep.

🛏️ S L E E P . . .

🤝 Oh, by the way I am a Frontend Web Developer and now I use Vue stack (Nuxt, Pinia, ...)

🤔 Do you want a joke?
